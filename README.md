# SimpleStorage Smart Contract

This project is a Solidity smart contract built using Remix IDE. The contract demonstrates various fundamental and advanced concepts in Solidity, including mappings, events, storage types, enums, and different function visibilities. Itâ€™s designed to provide practical experience in handling data and optimizing for gas efficiency, with an organized contract that tracks favorite numbers, stores user data, and logs updates with events.

## Project Overview

The **SimpleStorage** contract includes the following features:
- **Mappings** for efficient data management.
- **Events** to log and communicate important actions.
- **Enums** to handle different states of the contract.
- **Storage types**: Demonstrates the use of `storage`, `memory`, and `calldata` and their impact on gas usage.
- **Function visibilities**: Demonstrates `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external` functions.

## Contract Details

### Key Components

1. **Mappings**: 
   - The contract uses mappings to store each person's favorite number by their name.
   
2. **Events**:
   - An event, `NumberUpdated`, is emitted whenever the `favoriteNumber` is updated, allowing easy tracking of this change.

3. **Storage Types**:
   - The contract uses different storage types (`storage`, `memory`, and `calldata`) to optimize gas usage for temporary vs. permanent data.

4. **Enums**:
   - An enum `ContractState` is used to represent the contract's active and inactive states.

5. **Function Visibilities**:
   - Functions with `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external` visibilities are used to demonstrate their roles and limitations.

## Functions

- `storeNumber(uint256 _favoriteNumber)`: Stores a favorite number.
- `getFavoriteNumber()`: Returns the stored favorite number.
- `isGreaterThan(uint256 _compareValue)`: Checks if the stored number is greater than a given value.
- `sumFavorite()`: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 up to the stored favorite number.
- `addFavoriteNumber(uint256 _number)`: Adds a number to the list of favorite numbers.
- `addPersonToMapping(string memory _name, uint256 _favoriteNumber)`: Adds a person and their favorite number to the mapping.
- `storeFavoriteNumber(uint256 _favoriteNumber)`: Updates the favorite number and emits an event.
- `contractStateString(string calldata _inputString)`: Concatenates a string with " is awesome!" and returns it.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will have:
- Gained practical experience with mappings to manage data efficiently.
- Learned how to use events to log and communicate important actions.
- Mastered the differences between storage, memory, and calldata and their impact on gas usage.
- Developed and deployed an advanced smart contract that incorporates multiple concepts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Remix IDE** (or any Solidity compiler) for compiling and deploying the contract.
- **MetaMask** or other Ethereum wallet for interacting with the contract on test networks.

### Deployment
1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Copy the contract code into a new Solidity file.
3. Compile the contract using Solidity version `0.8.25`.
4. Deploy the contract on the Remix JavaScript VM or connect Remix to a test network like Rinkeby or Goerli.

### Testing
- You can test the contract directly in Remix by calling each function and observing the results.
- Track events in Remix to see updates logged by the `NumberUpdated` event.
